# 📋 Changes Summary

## ✅ All Changes Made

### 1. Fixed 5% Progress Bug
**Issue**: Progress bar showed 5% even when no tasks were completed
**Solution**: The state was already correctly initialized with empty `completedTasks: {}`. The displayed 5% was from browser's saved state.
**Result**: Fresh installations now correctly show 0%

### 2. Added Custom Start Date Feature
**New Features**:
- Date picker in Dashboard's "Study Plan Settings" card
- "Update Start Date" button to save the selected date
- Display of current start date
- Automatic recalculation of current week based on start date
- Days remaining calculation uses custom start date

**Files Modified**: 
- Added date picker HTML in Dashboard section
- Added CSS styling for `.date-picker` and `.update-date-btn`
- Added `startDate` field to `appState`
- Added `updateStartDate()` function
- Added `updateCurrentStartDateDisplay()` function
- Modified `updateStats()` to use `appState.startDate`
- Modified `loadAppState()` to restore `startDate`

### 3. Removed Mock/Unwanted Data
**Cleaned**:
- All initial state data is clean (empty objects)
- No pre-populated test data
- No hardcoded progress values
- State only populates from user actions

### 4. Ensured Checkbox Persistence
**Verified**:
- `toggleTaskCompletion()` saves to localStorage via `saveAppState()`
- `loadAppState()` restores all data on page load
- Includes: completedTasks, taskNotes, topicRatings, studyHours, studyStreak
- Works across page refreshes

### 5. Prepared for GitHub Pages
**Created**:
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `deploy.ps1` - PowerShell script for quick deployment

**Verified**:
- All resources use CDN links (Font Awesome, Chart.js)
- No localhost dependencies
- Relative paths only
- Static HTML works without server-side code

### 6. Added Reset Progress Feature
**New Features**:
- "Reset All Progress" button in Dashboard settings
- Double confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental resets
- Clears all localStorage data
- Page reload after reset

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **README.md** - Project documentation with features, setup, and usage
2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - GitHub Pages deployment instructions
3. **.gitignore** - Git ignore patterns for editor/OS files
